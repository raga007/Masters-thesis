%%% This file is free and can be modified or distributed as long as

%%% This file contains a template that can be used with the package
%%% utthesis.sty and LaTeX2e to produce a thesis that meets the requirements
%%% of the Graduate School of The University of Texas at Austin.
%%%
%%% All of the commands defined by utthesis.sty have default values (see
%%% the file utthesis.sty for these values).  Thus, theoretically, you
%%% don't need to define values for any of them; you can run this file
%%% through LaTeX2e and produce an acceptable thesis, without any text.
%%% However, you probably want to set at least some of the macros (like
%%% \thesisauthor).  In that case, replace "..." with appropriate values,
%%% and uncomment the line (by removing the leading %'s).

Quite a few people have helped me, directly or indirectly, to complete
this work. I apologize in advance to those who I will not explicitly
mention here due to lack of space. You all have my gratitude for your
help.

First and the foremost, I would like to thank my adviser
\mbox{Dr. Sarfraz Khurshid} for his amazing support and encouragement
throughout my time in graduate school. Sarfraz has been a great mentor
and has given me some very useful advise when I needed it the most. I
have learnt a lot from the way he simplifies problems and solves
them. I would also like to thank \mbox{Dr. Razieh Nokhbeh Zaeem} for
taking the time to evaluate this work and giving valuable feedback.

I thank my friends, \mbox{Vidhoon Vishwanathan}, \mbox{Janaki Kannan},
\mbox{Srinivasan} \\ \mbox{Sivaramachandran}, \mbox{Prachi Mehta} and
\mbox{Divya Gadde} for all the jokes and serious comments they made
about my thesis. I am thankful to the National Science Foundation (NSF
Grant Nos. CCF-0845628 and CNS-0958231) for funding this work.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my sister, \mbox{Ishwarya},
my mother, \mbox{Jayalakshmi} and my father, \mbox{Srinivasan}, for
their enormous love, care and support.
